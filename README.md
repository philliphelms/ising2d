# ising2d
This code was developed as part of the Simon's Institute Summer School, 2018.

The overall goal of this code is to determine the ground state of the 2D Ising model, 
but the goal of the exercise is to practice the following:
-Pair Programming
-Test Driven Development
-Version Control (via git/github)
-Continuous Integration (via travis-ci)
-Documentation (via Doxygen)
